# edge-sizing
Edge Sizing and y+ Calculation in ANSYS Meshing

This contains two different options.

1. app.py
2. app_Water.py

## app.py

This contains general edge sizing app where y+ is calculated for a turbulent pipe flow with input properties and velocity and geometry parameters.

## app_Water.py

This can calculate the thermophysical properties for Water from IAPWS module from initial temperature and properties and calculate the smallest cell size and y+ accordingly.
